in this project in resume.pug file ,the image of users is taken from file location in system not from the database...
for the contribution it can be done...
 we can set that pic source from the database
 using  <img scr='data: image/jpg;base64,img.data.toString('base64'}'>
 and also we can add some security page like updating resume or show all resume we should ask for the password


i made the backupfile and delete the data from the database 
before useing this app please restore all the data from backup file (mongorestore)
